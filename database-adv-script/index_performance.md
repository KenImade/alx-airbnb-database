# Query Performance Analysis

This is a report analysing the performance of various queries before and after implementing indexing.

## Indexes to be implemented

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_user_role ON "User" (role);
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_start_date ON Booking(start_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_end_date ON Booking(end_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_property_location ON Property(location);
CREATE INDEX idx_property_pricepernight ON Property(pricepernight);
```

## Â Queries Tested

### 1. Guest Booking History

Retrieves all bookings for a specific guest with property and host details.

```sql
    EXPLAIN ANALYZE
    SELECT 
        b.booking_id,
        b.start_date,
        b.end_date,
        b.total_price,
        b.status,
        p.name as property_name,
        p.location,
        u.first_name || ' ' || u.last_name as host_name
    FROM Booking b
    JOIN Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
    JOIN "User" u ON p.host_id = u.user_id
    WHERE b.user_id = (SELECT user_id FROM "User" WHERE email = 'alice@example.com')
    ORDER BY b.start_date DESC;
```

**Query Performance Summary**: (~ 55% decrease in execution time)

| Before/After Indexing    | Execution Time (ms) |
|--------------------------|-------------------  |
| Before Indexing          | 0.594               |
| After Indexing           | 0.268               |

### 2. Total Revenue per Host

Calculate total revenue per host

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name || ' ' || u.last_name as host_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT p.property_id) as total_properties,
    COUNT(b.booking_id) as total_bookings,
    COALESCE(SUM(pay.amount), 0) as total_revenue
FROM "User" u
JOIN Property p ON u.user_id = p.host_id
LEFT JOIN Booking b ON p.property_id = b.property_id
LEFT JOIN Payment pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id
WHERE u.role = 'host'
GROUP BY u.user_id, u.first_name, u.last_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

**Query Performance Summary**: (~ 81% decrease in execution time)

| Before/After Indexing    | Execution Time (ms) |
|--------------------------|-------------------  |
| Before Indexing          | 2.171               |
| After Indexing           | 0.416               |

### 3. Properties with no bookings

Find properties with no bookings (available properties)

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    p.property_id,
    p.name,
    p.location,
    p.pricepernight,
    u.first_name || ' ' || u.last_name as host_name
FROM Property p
JOIN "User" u ON p.host_id = u.user_id
LEFT JOIN Booking b ON p.property_id = b.property_id
WHERE b.booking_id IS NULL
ORDER BY p.pricepernight;
```

**Query Performance Summary**: (~ 25% decrease in execution time)

| Before/After Indexing    | Execution Time (ms) |
|--------------------------|-------------------  |
| Before Indexing          | 0.349               |
| After Indexing           | 0.260               |

### 4. Property Metrics

Get properties with their average rating and review count.

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    p.property_id,
    p.name,
    p.location,
    p.pricepernight,
    COUNT(r.review_id) as review_count,
    ROUND(AVG(r.rating), 2) as average_rating
FROM Property p
LEFT JOIN Review r ON p.property_id = r.property_id
GROUP BY p.property_id, p.name, p.location, p.pricepernight
HAVING COUNT(r.review_id) > 0
ORDER BY average_rating DESC, review_count DESC;
```

**Query Performance Summary**: (~ 5% decrease in execution time)

| Before/After Indexing    | Execution Time (ms) |
|--------------------------|-------------------  |
| Before Indexing          | 0.356               |
| After Indexing           | 0.340               |

### 5. Booking Details

Find upcoming bookings with payment status.

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    p.name as property_name,
    u.first_name || ' ' || u.last_name as guest_name,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price,
    b.status as booking_status,
    COALESCE(SUM(pay.amount), 0) as amount_paid,
    b.total_price - COALESCE(SUM(pay.amount), 0) as amount_due
FROM Booking b
JOIN Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
JOIN "User" u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
LEFT JOIN Payment pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id
WHERE b.start_date > CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY b.booking_id, p.name, u.first_name, u.last_name, b.start_date, 
         b.end_date, b.total_price, b.status
ORDER BY b.start_date;
```

**Query Performance Summary**: (~ 13% decrease in execution time)

| Before/After Indexing    | Execution Time (ms) |
|--------------------------|-------------------  |
| Before Indexing          | 0.580               |
| After Indexing           | 0.505               |
